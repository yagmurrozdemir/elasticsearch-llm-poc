## Natural Language to Elasticsearch Query Generator

This project is a complete pipeline that uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **vector embeddings** to automatically **translate natural language queries** into **Elasticsearch DSL queries**, execute them, and compare the results to ground-truth queries.

The system is based on:
- LLM prompt engineering for DSL query generation
- CLIP model embeddings for semantic vector search
- Automatic query execution and evaluation against real Elasticsearch indexes
